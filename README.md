# h9s (howbernetes)

## Overview

h9s (howbernetes) is a simplified implementation of Kubernetes, designed as a learning project to gain deep insights into container orchestration and distributed systems. 

The primary goals of this project are:

1. **Developing Systems Design Experience**
   - Face challenges in designing a system similar to Kubernetes to improve architectural skills
   - Learn about trade-offs in scalability and reliability

2. **Enhancing Problem-Solving Skills**
   - Tackle complex problems, with a particular focus on state management

Through this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of distributed systems architecture and hone my ability to solve intricate technical challenges.

## Getting Started

To use h9s, you'll need to set up the control plane on one local machine and the worker node on another. For detailed setup and running instructions, please refer to the README files in the respective directories:

- [Control Plane Setup](./control-plane/README.md)
- [Worker Node Setup](./worker-node/README.md)

These README files contain all the necessary information to get each component up and running, as well as instructions for connecting the worker node to the control plane.
